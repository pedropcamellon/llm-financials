Our average payment terms with the supplier are 30 days, which are 5 days lower compared to the average payment terms of the total analyzed spend.
On this particular spend ('Spend 1') of USD 155.4k, based on the analysis performed by the ADA Platform with a moderate approach, we recommend extending our current payment terms with the supplier by 45 days.
The additional 45 days extension with the supplier moves our terms to 75 days, which represents USD 19.2k of working capital optimization for our organization.

Pay on Terms Strategy
On this spend ("Spend 1"), we have current average payment terms of 30 days while our contractual payment terms are 30 days.
Thus, there is no opportunity to increase our payment terms as our actual terms on this spend ("Spend 1") are already equal to the contractual terms agreed with Bel S.R.L..


Supplier Parent Strategy
There is no opportunity to improve our payment terms based on the Supplier Parent Strategy as there is no other supplier owned by the same parent company within the analyzed spend portfolio.


Industry Group Strategy
The ADA Platform did not identify any other suppliers in the analyzed spend belonging to the same industry as Bel S.R.L..


Spend Group Strategy
Unfortunately, there is no opportunity to optimize our payment terms based on the Supplier Group Strategy as there is no other spend with Bel S.R.L. in our analyzed spend portfolio.


DSO Strategy
The DSO (Days Sales Outstanding) can be used as a proxy for the company’s receivables collection time — a valuable data point to understand what payment term may be achievable. However, please note that in some industries (e.g. financial services) DSO can be an imperfect measure and can be misleading.
There is a potential opportunity as Bel S.R.L. has a DSO of 121 days. The high DSO could indicate longer agreed payment terms with other customers compared to us.
If we would increase our payment terms on this spend ("Spend 1") from 30 to 121 days, we could improve of our working capital by USD 38.8k.
On the other hand, the new potential payment terms of 121 days represent an increase of 303.3% in payment terms for Bel S.R.L..


Financing Strategy
If Bel S.R.L. was offered the option to participate in the selected financing program, they could benefit from a lower annual financing rate of approximately 4.09%.
By comparing the supplier's estimated cost of financing of 7.27% with the selected financing rate of 4.09% we identified a potential opportunity to extend our payment terms to a maximum of 95 days, which would result in USD 27.7k additional cash flow for our organization.
If the payment terms with them were extended to 95 days, the impact would be cost-neutral for our supplier. In other words, the low financing rate we are offering is offsetting the longer payment terms.


Cash Discount Conversion Strategy
Unfortunately, there is no opportunity to extend payment terms based on the Cash Discount Conversion Strategy as we have no cash discounts as per our contract with Bel S.R.L. on this spend ("Spend 1").


Peer Group Average Strategy
The Peer Group Average is a good indicator of a supplier’s payment terms with comparable companies selling similar goods and services to similar customers to us.
ADA Platform identified an opportunity as Bel S.R.L.'s peer group has on average payment term 55 days. In comparison with our current average payment terms of this spend ("Spend 1") with our supplier, we pay 25 days earlier than the market average.
Based on this strategy, we could extend our payment terms by 25 days to be aligned with the market and the peer group average of Bel S.R.L..
By implementing the new payment terms of 55 days, we have the potential opportunity to improve our working capital and cash flow by USD 10.7k.
On the other hand, the potential increase on payment terms of 25 days for this spend ("Spend 1") represent an increase of 83.3%.


Regulatory Terms Strategy
Please note that there are regulatory limitations or payment terms legislations in Italy where Bel S.R.L. is located. These regulations may limit the length of payment terms that can be applied.
The regulation published for the country: Italy and/or the industry: Converted Paper Product Manufacturing are 60 days.
Please note, however, that a payment terms negotiation and extension cannot be based solely on this information. On many occasions, some regulations are not applied in the market and are only used as general guidance. In other cases, if terms are lower, the regulatory standard can be used to reinforce the message when to improve payment terms.
